## Files

- on-board/
    - main.rs -> basically just the loop and some metacode; creates a rocket.rs instance and runs an init() and a loop() or similar
    - rocket.rs -> where subsytems are created, where events are made, the event manager is setup, etc
    - subsystems/
        - base.rs -> just a template and some meta stuff that will help with other subsystems
        - example_subsytem.rs -> the actual subsystems
        - mod.rs -> mod basically just has a `pub mod example_subsystem;` for each subsystem. basically makes that stuff accessible from other files.
    - events/
        - base.rs -> event base, event manager, and access stuff
        - example_event.rs -> an event
        - mod.rs -> same as other mod.rs but with events
    - utils/
        - constants.rs -> constants
        - util.rs -> anything that's used more than once across files, so prolly basic pin access, etc
        - mod.rs -> another one of these
- ground-station/
    - main.py -> idk yet
- remote/
    - main.py -> idk yet
    - gui.py -> gui stuff
